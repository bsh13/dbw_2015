# Git and GitHub Tutorial

The instructions in `tutorial.ipynb` walk you through how to do some basic things with Git and GitHub. Note that while this is an IPython notebook, it runs using a bash kernel. This means that the statements in its cells are not written in Python, but are rather meant to be entered at the command line. In fact, it is highly recommended that you follow along by copying the statements we go through into the command line (i.e., in your terminal window) and running them there. However, if you want to still use the IPython notebook editor to edit the toy python file we'll be using in the example, then you can run `ipython notebook` to get started.
